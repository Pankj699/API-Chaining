**API Chaining CRUD Operations using Postman**
This repository provides an example of how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using API chaining in Postman. API chaining involves linking multiple API requests together so that the output of one request becomes the input for the next. This approach can streamline workflows and testing processes.

**Introduction**
API chaining allows you to perform a sequence of API requests where each request depends on the data from the previous one. This technique is particularly useful for automated testing and complex workflows.

**Collection Overview**
The Postman collection includes the following requests:

1. Create Resource: Creates a new resource on the server.
2. Get Resource: Retrieves the newly created resource using its ID.
3. Update Resource: Updates the retrieved resource.
4. Delete Resource: Deletes the updated resource.
